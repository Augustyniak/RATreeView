Introduction
-----------------

RATreeView is a class designed to provide easy and pleasant way to work with tree views on iOS. It works as a wrapper for the UITableView, defining its own delegate and data source methods which make working with tree data structures really easy.

RATreeView is highly customizable and has a lot of features. 


Installation
-----------------

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add RATreeView to your project.

1. Add additional entry to your Podfile.

  ```ruby
  pod "RATreeView", "~> 1.0.3"
  ```

2. Install  Pod(s) running `pod install` command.
3. Include RATreeView using `#import <RATreeView.h>`.

###Source files

1. Downloaded the latest version of the library using [link](https://github.com/Augustyniak/RATreeView/archive/master.zip).
2. Copy content of the downloaded (and unzipped) zip file into your project by dragging it into Project's navigator files structure. 



Requirements
-----------------


* Xcode 5
* iOS 5
* ARC
* QuartzCore


Usage
-----------------


Check out the demo for example usage of library. Make sure you read the [RATreeView documentation on Cocoa Docs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RATreeView/1.0.3).


### Basics

1. Add following import in file of your project when you want to use RATreeView:
 
   ```objc
   // In case you are using RATreeView with CocoaPods
   #import<RATreeView.h>
   ```
      
   ```objc
   // In case you are using RATreeView by simply copying 
   // source files of the RATreeView into your project
   #import ""RATreeView.h"
   ``` 
 
2. Simplest way to initialize and configure RATreeView:

   ```objc
   RATreeView *treeView = [[RATreeView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
   treeView.delegate = self;
   treeView.dataSource = self;       
   [self.view addSubview:treeView];
   [treeView reloadData];
   ```
         
3. Implement required methods of the RATreeView's data source:
 
   ```objc
   - (NSInteger)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView numberOfChildrenOfItem:(id)item
   {
       return item ? 3 : 0;
   }
   ```

   ```objc
   - (UITableViewCell *)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView cellForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo
   {
      // create and configure cell for *item*
      return cell
   }
   ```

   ```objc
   - (id)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView child:(NSInteger)index ofItem:(id)item
   {
      return @(index);
   }
   ```
