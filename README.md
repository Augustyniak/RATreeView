RATreeView is a class designed to provide easy and pleasant way to work with tree views on iOS and tvOS. It works as a wrapper for the UITableView, defining its own delegate and data source methods which make working with tree data structures really easy.

RATreeView is highly customizable and has a lot of features. 


Installation
-----------------

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add RATreeView to your project.

1. Add additional entry to your Podfile.

  ```ruby
  pod "RATreeView", "~> 2.1.2"
  ```

2. Install Pod(s) running `pod install` command.
3. Include RATreeView using `#import <RATreeView.h>`.

###Source files

1. Downloaded the latest version of the library using [link](https://github.com/Augustyniak/RATreeView/archive/master.zip).
2. Copy content of the downloaded (and unzipped) zip file into your project by dragging it into Project's navigator files structure. 



Requirements
-----------------


* Xcode 5
* iOS 7 or newer/tvOS 9 or newer


Usage
-----------------


Check out the demo for example usage of library. Make sure you read the [RATreeView documentation on Cocoa Docs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RATreeView/2.1.2).


### Basics

1. Add following import in file of your project when you want to use RATreeView:
 
   ```objc
   // In case you are using RATreeView with CocoaPods
   #import <RATreeView.h>
   ```
      
   ```objc
   // In case you are using RATreeView by simply copying 
   // source files of the RATreeView into your project
   #import "RATreeView.h"
   ``` 
 
2. Simplest way to initialize and configure RATreeView:

   ```objc
   RATreeView *treeView = [[RATreeView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
   treeView.delegate = self;
   treeView.dataSource = self;       
   [self.view addSubview:treeView];
   [treeView reloadData];
   ```
         
3. Implement required methods of the RATreeView's data source:
 
   ```objc
   - (NSInteger)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView numberOfChildrenOfItem:(id)item
   {
       return item ? 3 : 0;
   }
   ```

   ```objc
   - (UITableViewCell *)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView cellForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo
   {
      // create and configure cell for *item*
      return cell
   }
   ```

   ```objc
   - (id)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView child:(NSInteger)index ofItem:(id)item
   {
      return @(index);
   }
   ```

### Adding Pull to Refresh control

Adding pull to refresh gesture is really easy using `RATreeView` and standard `UIRefreshControl` control.

[![](https://raw.github.com/Augustyniak/RATreeView/master/Screens/PullToRefresh.png)](https://raw.github.com/Augustyniak/RATreeView/master/Screens/PullToRefresh.png)

   ```objc
UIRefreshControl *refreshControl = [UIRefreshControl new];
[refreshControl addTarget:self action:@selector(refreshControlChanged:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];
[treeView.scrollView addSubview:refreshControl];
   ```
